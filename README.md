# Hangman

This is my first 100+ lines of code project in python in my journey to get a job as a SWE xD Please enjoy and follow me on this path :)

Note:
- Download random.txt and put these 2 files in the same directory for it to work easily. Else change the code as commented.
- You can only guess one letter at a time. I might implement a feature later to guess a whole word together but we'll have to see :D
- You have 6 tries and have to guess the right word within the limited counter.

Simple as that! Please play :)
